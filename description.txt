I have a firewall that I need to give users the ability to add/remove addresses from it without logging into the appliance. For simplicity, I've hard coded a customername and a list of ip addresses. As the application goes through adding/removing, it needs to keep track of the customername.

If I can get a python list of items, I can then use another python module to ssh into the appliance.

Please use Flask, Python, Jinja, Bootstrap, Javascript


So I want to pass in the list of addresses to the .html page.

On the page I want a list of checkboxes and some text fields.

The list of checkboxes will show all of the addresses. The user can check which ones they want to remove.

They can type in up to five IP addresses to add.

They click submit and the things that are checked needs to be passed back to flask so I can process it.

The things they type on the text fields needs to be sent back in a separate list so I can process it.

Send the lists and send the customername back to flask and store in new variables
